### 0. Introduction

- []

### 1. The Judgment of Thamus

- We shouldn‚Äôt make the mistake of thinking that every technological innovation has a one sided effect (good or bad)
- Technology has a way of commandeering our values - and we don‚Äôt stop to question how that changes them and how we feel about that
- We tend, throughout history, to give people who ‚Äúcultivate confidence‚Äù in new tech a status of ‚Äúundeserved authority and prestige‚Äù from the rest of society
- The ‚Äúwinners‚Äù of technology have incentive to encourage the ‚Äúlosers‚Äù to still be excited about tech, and whenever questions pop up, can dazzle the ‚Äúlosers‚Äù with a flashy part of tech. 
- Tech ‚Äúcreates new conceptions of what is real‚Äù and by doing so, undermines older conceptions. Ex. Assigning grades to essay questions, starting in 1792 in Cambridge University. Giving a number to the quality of thought, and paving the way for the same for love, hate, beauty, creativity, etc. He didn‚Äôt mean to include human feeling, but now that happens as well. 
- Embedded in every tool is an ideological bias.
- Technological change has an ecological change effect - it fundamentally changes the entire thing. It‚Äôs not a simple add-on. 

### 2. From Tools to Technocracy

- Marx understood: technologies ‚Äúcreate the ways in which people perceive reality‚Äù
- Culture classified into types: 1) tool using cultures (all cultures before the 17th century), 2) technocracies, and 3) technopolies
  - Tools invented for functional or symbolic purposes, and did not conflict with people believing in their traditions, religion, politics, education, etc. Their beliefs ‚Üí tools. 
  - Tool using cultures defined by the relationship between tools and the belief system or ideology. That belief system creates the tools, the tools are well integrated into that system. 
  - Technocracy - the tools play a central role in the thought-world of the culture. Tools are increasingly not integrated into the culture, attack the culture. Try to become the culture. Belief systems have to fight against tools. 
  - Kepler, building on work of Copernicus, did the first call for a separation of moral and intellectual values, a separation which is one of the pillars of a technocracy (although he did so lightly and was still religious and left room for God). Galileo took it further by making astronomy a source of ‚Äúpain and confusion to the prevailing theology‚Äù. These three blew up the theology of the medieval world. Then Newton. They all kept their religion but laid the groundwork.
  - Francis Bacon (1561 - 1626) was first man of technocratic age. Saw the connection between science and improvement of human condition. His work was to advance the happiness of mankind, saw science‚Äôs only goal is ‚Äúendowment of human life with new inventions and riches‚Äù. He wasn‚Äôt really a scientist but was a good communicator of ideas. He also did a lot of work to make science more accessible to the public, like advocating for public lectures. Europe took 150 years after death to pass to mentality of the modern world / technocracy.

### 3. From Technocracy to Technopoly

- First technocracy was in England in last half of 18th century 
  - James Watt invented steam engine in 1765
  - 1776, Adam Smith‚Äôs wealth of nations ‚Üí justified the switch from small-scale personalized skilled labor to large scale impersonal mechanized production. Money > land in defining wealth. Principle of invisible hand. 
- Richard Arkwright - First technocratic capitalist - developed the factory system in 1770/80s. 
- 1860s - fervor for invention took hold of the masses
  - Not a question of why to invent things, just how. Learning how = less questions about why. 
  - Belief that invention succeeds through objectivity, efficiency, expertise, standardization, measurement, and progress. Most efficient when people are not people, but markets. 
- Bacon‚Äôs fault was that he didn‚Äôt talk about the consequences of tech change. 
- 19th century and technocracy = more respect for individual person, potential and convenience were important. Public education, literacy, libraries, etc. 
  - French revolution - WWI = oasis of quality for great literature to reach the masses, as well as religious and political freedom (partially from stress placed on individuality)
- Technocracy sped up the world. Time was something to triumph over with technology. The United States embraced this and soared to power. No real focus on what we were leaving behind (thoreau talked about it). People weren‚Äôt worried, because didn‚Äôt feel like technocracy would fully destroy beliefs/ideologies/culture - which it didn‚Äôt. It just worked against them, made it more confusing, confliced. Until 19th century, when they really went against each other. But American couldn‚Äôt fully erase the old beliefs. Industrialisms was too new and couldn‚Äôt completely supplant old world cultures / tool using cultural values. 
- Technopoly makes the old thought-world disappear. It eliminates alternatives to itself. ‚ÄúIt does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant. And it does so by redefining what we mean by religion, by art, by family, by politics, by history, by truth, by privacy, by intelligence, so that our definitions fit its new requirements. Technopoly, in other words, is totalitarian technocracy.‚Äù
- The Unites States is the only culture to become a Technopoly. 
- The Principles of Scientific Management by Taylor, 1911. He only meant for ‚Äúscientific management‚Äù only for industrial production. It was a system that relieved workers of the burden of thinking - idea that technique of any kind can do our thinking for us. He provided the first formal outline of the assumptions in the thought-world of technopoly:
  - The primary goal of human labor and thought is efficiency
  - Technical calculation is superior in all respects to human judgement
  - human judgement cannot be trusted because it is plagued by laxity, ambiguity, and unnecessary complexity
  - subjectivity is an obstacle to clear thinking 
  - that which cannot be measured either does not exist or is of no value
  - that the affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by experts 
- Technocracies are concerned with inventing machinery - and changes to people‚Äôs lives are taken with that, and that people are sometimes seen as machines is considered necessary and unfortunate. But this isn‚Äôt held up as culture. It doesn‚Äôt expect you to find meaning in machinery and techniques. 
- Technopoly places meaning and culture in machines. Frederick Taylor who first stated that we‚Äôre beneath machines, that society is best when humans are at the disposal of techniques and technology. 
- Technopoly emerged in america because: 
  - A land of wonders, no limitations - maybe from immigrant roots, frontier mentality, abundant natural resources, political and religious freedom. American distrust of constraints. 
  - Genius and audacity of American capitalists of late 19th/early 20th centuries. Exploited economic possibilities of tech. Not concerned with preserving past, esp if in the way of tech innovation. 
  - Tech in 20th century was successful in providing convenience, comfort, speed, hygiene, and abundance. Seemed so great, no need to look elsewhere. 
    - Prayer vs. penicillin
    - Family roots vs. mobility
    - reading vs. TV
    - restraint vs. immediate gratification
    - sin vs. psychotherapy
    - political ideology vs. popular appeal established through scientific polling
    - death vs. longer life / cryogenics
  - Old sources of belief under siege. Lose confidence in believe systems. Only thing that you can see that ‚Äúworks‚Äù is technology. 
    - Nietzsche announced god was dead
    - Darwin
    - Marx = history has its own agenda
    - Freud = we don‚Äôt know our deepest needs, can‚Äôt trust traditional ways of exploring 
    - John Watsom (founder of behaviorism), showed free will was an illusion and behavior was not unlike pigeons
    - Einstein = no absolute means of judging anything in any case, everything is relative 

### 4. The Improbable World

- When we started moving on from old traditions, wasn‚Äôt immediately clear what we were losing, since it happened at the same time as the rise of the narrative of Progress. Works within and outside of religious contexts. 
- Information became the new god of culture. Problem - solved information scarcity, which was easy to see benefits of. But didn‚Äôt solve problems of information glut. 
  - Result = information chaos 
  - Few recognize this as the source of their distress
- ‚ÄúThe fact is, there are very few political, social, and especially personal problems that arise because of insufficient information.‚Äù Yet Technopolist will keep saying we need more information, that that will solve problems. 
- Schools = technocracy‚Äôs first secular bureaucracy. Legitimize some parts of info flow and discrediting others. 
- The Control Revolution by James Beniger 
- Information is ‚Äúdangerous when it has no place to go, when there is no theory to which is applies, no pattern in which it fits, when there is no higher purpose that it serves.‚Äù 
- What led to this? Technological conditions: 
- 1st stage of info revolution: Printing press
  - created new sources of data collection and increased comms among scientists across continents. Created standardization. Created new environment of information. Increased importance of individuality.  
- With that, western culture got on a course to make technocracies possible. But nothing significant happened after printing press from 17th century to mid-19th. Nothing that altered the form, volume, and speed of information. Western culture had 200 hundred years to adjust. Developed institutions. New conceptions of knowledge (more respect for reason and privacy). economic activity like mechanized production and corporate capitalisms. Expressed humane socialism. Public discourse through newspapers, books. 
- Technocratic-typographic America was the first nation ever to be argued into existence in print. US Constitution. A belief in privacy, individuality, intellectual freedom, open criticism, and community action. 
- 2nd stage of info revolution: Telegraph
  - Invention of telegraph at end of 19th century. 
  - Loss of the presumed close connection between information, reason, and usefulness. Information now doesn‚Äôt have to be local. 
  - Transit and info were disengaged
  - Context-free information. Info doesn‚Äôt have to be tied to any function it might serve in social and political decision making and action. Info is now a commodity. Not need to be attached to meaning. 
  - Penny-press also helped this happen. 
- 3rd stage of info revolution: photography
  - Same time as telegraphy
  - Intrusion of images into the symbolic environment
  - photos, posters, drawings, ads
  - Replace language as our dominant means for construing, understanding, and testing reality. 
- 20th century - info grew exponentially. Values:
  - interconnectedness is necessary
  - can proceed without context
  - argue for instancy instead of historical continuity
  - fascination in place of complexity and coherence 
- 4th stage info revolution: broadcasting
- 5th stage info revolution: computer technology
- Technopoly is successful when the environment creates: information and human purpose are not connected. information isn‚Äôt connected to anything in particular, high volume, high speed, disconnected from theory, meaning, purpose. 
  - Human progress has been replaced by technological progress
  - The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering - rather, to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies.
  - We tell ourselves this will lead to a better life, but that is ‚Äúrhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy‚Äù. 
  - We think information is our friend, don‚Äôt ask how to control it. Low / no understanding of the consequences - cultures suffer from information glut, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.
