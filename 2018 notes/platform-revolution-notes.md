## Chapter 7: Openness

### Chapter focus: 

### Notes: 

- Managers face 3 kinds of openness decisions
  - Manager/sponsor participation
  - Developer participation
  - User participation
  
- Management and sponsorship of a platform can be controlled by:
    - A single firm
    - Different firms
    - Groups of firms
  - Depending on these (4) combinations, ther are different patterns of openness and control, different advantages and disadvantages.

- Open vs. Closed
  - There is a spectrum of open vs. closed
  - There are benefits/drawbacks to choices at every point on that spectrum
  - Two separate platforms may compete on the basis of how they differ in level of open/closed
  
- As platforms mature, they tend to grow in the direction of openness (although sometimes the opposite direction). 
  - Changes in open/closed come from reevaluation and adjustment of curation processes
  - Goal: great high quality platform content and service value
