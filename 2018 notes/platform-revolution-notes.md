## Chapter 7: Openness

### Notes: 

🔖 **Definition of openness:**
> A platform is 'open' to the extent that: 
> 1. No restrictions are placed on participation in its development, commercialization, or use; or
> 2. any restrictions - for example, requirements ot conform with technical standards or pay licensing fees - are reasonable and non-discriminatory, that is, they are applied uniformly to all potential platform participants.

- Openness levels exist on a spectrum, and where a business decides to land on that spectrum affects usage, developer participation, monetization, and regulation. 
- There are pros/cons at ever point in the spectrum
- Defining who has access, and how they can participate is very complex. Should be at the top of a platform managers agenda at all times. 

💼 **Wikipedia:**
- Wikipedia is the most popular reference site in the world
- Is a universally accessible, unlimited source of data that should be reliable
- There are a lot of cases of misinformation on the site. Example: people editing the "Murder of Meredith Kercher" 8,000 times, mostly by people who are biased towards believing that Amanda Knox is guilty. 
- Wikipedia is an incredibly open platform, and this is a good example of the tradeoffs inherent in providing something that is openly accessible while trying to still maintain high quality. If Wikipedia were closed, it would reduce participation. 

💼 **Apple's transition from closed to something more balanced:**
- in 1980s, Jobs chose to keep the Apple Macintosh a closed system, while Microsoft opened an OS to outside developers and licensed it to many computer manufacturers. 
- Microsoft had a flood of innovation, Windows claimed a much larger share of the personal computer market. 
- In 2000s, Jobs opened the iPhone OS, made iTunes available on Windows. This was a better balance, Apple captured more o fthe smartphone market compared to Nokia and Blackberry. 
- Jobs interpreted the openness spectrum as "fragmented" (open) vs. "integrated" (closed); this terminoligy biased the debate to favor closed, controlled systems.

💼 **Myspace vs. Facebook:**
  - Myspace dominated social networking before Facebook. It released a ton of features, but constrained engineering resources meant they were often buggy and had poor user experience. Because Myspace kept their site closed to outside developers, the problem continued. 
  - In retrospect, cofounder Chris DeWolfe says that they should have focused on 5 - 10 key features and let the rest be built by outside developers. 
  - Facebook was initially closed to outside innovators, but opened to dot-com users in 2006 and started gaining on Myspace. 
  - The huge shift came from the launch of Facebook Platform, which launched in May 2007 to help developers create apps. By November, there were 7000 outside applications. Myspace reacted by also opening to developers in 2008, but it was too late. 
- Myspace's self-serve advertising feature opened the platform to significant amounts of inappropriate content, further degraded Myspace's attractiveness to users.
- This is an example of a platform being simultaneously too closed and too open. 

💼 **Youtube:**
- Highly open system = delivers a wide array of content from all types of content creators; is a true platform vs a distribution system.

🔑 **Three kinds of openness decisions that managers face:**
1. Manager/sponsor participation
    - Two entities behind a platform: a firm that manages the platform, and the firm that sponsors the platform 
    - Sometimes these are the same thing: Facebook, Uber, eBay, Airbnb. 
    - Sometimes these are not the same: Manager has more influence over daily operations and the developers, the sponsor has legal and economic control, as well as long-term strategy. 
    - See next 🔑 for examples
2. Developer participation
    - Managers need to control the level of openness to developers
    - See section on "🔑 developer participation" below.
3. User participation
    - Managers need to control the level of openness to users
    - See section on "🔑 user participation" below.
  
🔑 **1. Management and sponsorship of a platform can be controlled by:**
- Depending on 4 combinations, there are different patterns of openness and control, different advantages and disadvantages. A platform can also migrate from one model to another.  
- The Proprietary Model: A single firm does it all (provides the greatest control and faciliatates closed system of operation.)
  - Underlying hardware/software for the Mac OS and mobile iOS are controlled by Apple.
  - Feels like the dream; capture an entire market through developing a new technology standard and maintaining control over it. But this can backfire: 
    - 💼 **Betamax videotape sponsored by Sony vs. VHS sponsored by JVC.**
      - Betamax was higher quality, but this "war" was decided based on differing sponsorship/management strategies. 
      - Sony used proprietary model, JVC used licensing model. 
      - Manufacturers could produce VHS recorders and players, led to more volume and falling prices, more consumers buying. Movie studios issued more products in VHS format. 
      - VHS won out, although JVC didn't get much financially in the long run. 
- The Licensing Model: A group of firms manages, one firm sponsors (open at one end, closed at another)
  - Google sponsors the Android OS, but encourages other firms to supply devices. 
- The Joint Venture Model: Single firm manages, group of firms sponsor (open at one end, closed at another)
  - Orbitz launched as a joint venture with many major airlines.
  - Can be challenging to make key decisions when there's a committee of owners with different goals. 
    - 💼 **Visa**, which was sponsored by a number of banks since the 70s, ended up shifting the business to a self-contained entity that fit into the proprietary model in 2007. 
- The Shared Model: Groups of firms manages, another group of firms sponsors (open to both managers and sponsors)
  - Linux OS has a platform connecting app developers to consumers. Managing companies include TiVo, Roomba, Ubuntu, Qualcomm, while corporate sponsors include IBM, Intel, HP, Fujitsu, NEC, Oracle, Samsung.
  
- How do you choose which sponsorship/management model to choose? 
  - Tradeoffs inherent in these models are complicated. 
    - 💼 **Apple vs. Google smartphones**:
      - The iPhone (more controlled) considered more user friendly and aesthetically pleasing than Google's smartphone (less controlled).
      - Android Open Source Platform (AOSP) permits experimentation by any company. 
      - By 2014, open innovation led Android to 80 percent market share, Apple at 15 percent. 
      - Does this mean Google is better? Maybe not. AOSP OS doesn't channel users to Google's online services, which means Google gets no revenue or data flow from AOSP devices. Google is now reversing course and closing Android. 
  - Choose based on why the platform is being developed and the goals of those designing it:
    - 💼 **RFID tech**
      - Used to create smart tags for products for inventory control. 
      - Uses a shared model: sponsored by many retailers, manufactured by many companies. 
      - RFID doesn't generate huge profits, but it reaches the goal of the sponsors: make the technology simple, accessible, and affordable. 
      
🔑 **2. Developer Participation**
- Three kinds of developers: 
  1. Core developers: create the core platform cuntions that provide value to platform participants.
      - Goal: get the platform to users, deliver value through tools and rules around the core interaction. Responsible for basic platform capabilities. 
      - Generally employed at the platform management company.
  2. Extension developers: Add features and value to the platform and enhance its functionality. 
      - Usually outside parties. Managers have to decide how open they want to be to these developers and usually find ways to consequently profit from the value that this group creates.
      - Ex. People who produce apps sold via the iTunes store
      - Companies will usually create an application programming interface (API) to regulate and encourage these developers in their participation.
      - 🔖 **An API** is a standardized set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications that makes it easy for an outside programmer to write code that will connect with the platform infrastructure. 
      - 💼 **Walmart vs. Amazon's APIs**: Amazon has 300 API "mashups", Walmart has one API, which is partially why Amazon pulled ahead of Walmart in the stock market in 2015. 
      - 💼 **Salesforce** generates 50 percent of its revenues through APIs.
  3. Data aggregators
      - Enhance the matching function of the platform by adding data from multiple sources. They take data from the platform and sell to other companies for activities such as ad placement, and share profits with the original platform company. 
      - When it works well, it provides good matches for consumers. When it doesn't, it's very creepy. 
      - "Managing [this] appropriately poses an enormous ethical, legal, and business challenge."
  
      💼 **Developer Participation Case Study: Airbnb** 
      - Core developers: 
        - provides infrastructure that allows guests and hosts to interact. 
        - manages background functions that reduce transaction costs (ex. default insurance contracts for both parties)
      - Extension developers:
        - Ex. Developer now offers professional support under "Airbnb photography service" to create compelling images for hosts.
        - If Airbnb is too closed, makes it hard for extension developers to provide value. If too open, increases existance of low-quality providers which damage Airbnb's reputation, too many providers competing for the same profits. 
        - Airbnb takes the middle route: it has an API, but it is not open to all developers. 

      💼 **Developer participation and APIs case study: The Guardian**
      - The Guardian is a British daily newspaper. Originally closed to extension developers, but decided to "open in" the website "by bringing in more data and applications from the outside", and "open out" the site, by "enabling partners to create products using Guardian content and services on other digital platforms".
      - For "open out", they created a set of APIs with three different levels of access: 
        - 1. Keyless, the lowest access tier: anyone can use headlines, metadata, and information architecture without permission / without needing to share revenue.
        - 2. Approved, second access tier: allows time and usage restrictions, ad revenues are shared.
        - 3. Bespoke, highest tier: support package and gives unlimited content for a fee.
        - This has led to more products like a Politics API, and an app framework. Over 2,000 extension developers signed up in the first year. APIs can attract extension developers. 

      ❓When does the outside developer threaten that of the platform, and how should managers respond? 
      - Three principles to use when assessing the situation: 
        - 1. Based on the value created by a specific extension app. Don't let an outside developer control a main source of user value. One way to address this is to acquire the app. 
            - 💼 **Apple** owns most of the main apps on the iPhone. Bought SRI, the company behind Siri. 
        - 2. If an app has potential to become a powerful platform itself, the manager should try to own it or replace it. 
            - 💼 **Google Maps** was a popular feature on the iPhone, very powerful and popular. Apple decided to make its own mapping software, not dependent on Google anymore. 
        - 3. If specific functionality is reinvented by many extension developers and platform users like it, the manager of the platform should acquire this functionality and make it available through an API. Ex. Video/audio playback, photo editing, voice commands. = more innovation and better service for users.  

🔑 **3. User Participation**
- Managers need to address 🔖 **producer openness**: the right to freely add content to the platform
- Goal is usually high quality content, which means platforms cannot generally be completely open. 
- 🔖 **Curation**: content protection process that can be fine-tuned to land on the right level of producer openness. Usually takes the form of screening and feedback at critical points. 
  - Options: Can use human moderators, although this can be time-consuming and costly. Alternative is using the users themselves via software tools, although this is hard to design and implement. 
  - When curation tools bias towards openness, it can let in offensive and dangerous content. When they bias towards restrictions, valuable content can be lost. Platform managers need to devote a lot of resources, including human "eyeballs"/human judgement, to getting better at this balance.
  - 💼 **Wikipedia**: originally tried to be completely open, and assumed that users would be able to curate content/challenge biases. But reality was messy. 
    - Now relies on community standards and social pressure.
    - When that's not enough, uses other methods like VandalProof (software that highlights articles editing by "bad actor" users), tagging tools, blocking/prevention systems. 
  
🔑 **Two separate platforms may compete on the basis of how they differ in level of open/closed**
- There are a lot of factors in being competitive with other platforms, which can result in a never-ending balancing act and continuous adjustements of a platform's level of openness. 

🔑 **As platforms mature, they tend to grow in the direction of openness (although sometimes the opposite direction)** 
- Changes in open/closed come from reevaluation and adjustment of curation processes.
- Goal: great high quality platform content and service value.
- The challenge is finding a balance as openness policies evolve. 
- Example of struggle for control: 
  - SAP, a German company that makes software for large enterprises to manage internal operations. Partnered with ADP for payroll processing, which gave ADP the opportunity to replace SAP as the primary manager of the customer relationship. 

## Chapter 8: Governance

### Notes:

🔖 **Governance**: "the set of rules concerning who gets to participate in an ecosystem, how to divide the value, and how to resolve conflicts." The goal is to create wealth that is fairly distributed amongst those who add value to a platform.

🔑 **Three fundamental rules of good governance**
> - Always create value for the consumers you serve;
> - Don't use your power to change the rules in your favor;
> - Don't take more than a fair share of the wealth.

💼 **Keurig**
- Brian P. Kelley, CEO of Keurig Green Mountain Coffee Company. Keurig 1.0 had become ubiquitous. It's a one-sided platform.
- In 2012, patents for the Keurig coffee pod expired. Competing companies began selling pods that works in Keurig machines and were cheaper. (Similar to extension developers)
- Early 2015, launched Keurig 2.0, a next-gen coffee brewer. Included a scanning device to prevent any non-Keurig pods from working in the machine. Consumers were angry, vocal. Sales fell 12 percent. 
- This was a failure of ecosystem governance. Could have opted to become a beverage ecosystem with different options, suppliers, and services, but instead excluded suppliers that its customers liked which eliminated variety and freedom. It placed its interests above all others.

🔑 **Governance is even harder when a platform is multi-sided**
- Involves many interests that don't always align. Ex. LinkedIn making developers mad when they turned off access to APIs, Twitter doing a terrible job of dealing with abuse.

🔑 **Large platforms effectively regulate lives**
- Large platform businesses are like nation-states. With user bases that eclipse national populations and immense economic impact, giants like Facebook, Alibaba, and Google effectively regulate millions of lives.
- Platforms can learn from cities and states which have evolved the system of good governance over thousands of years, as they are faced with the same challenge of creating wealth and distributing it fairly.
- Evidence suggests that **"just governance" is crucial in the ability of a state to create wealth, even moreso than natural resources, good agricultural conditions, etc.**
- Absolutely free markets cannot be relied on to produce results that are fair to all involved. 
  - 💼 **Singapore**
    - Before 1959, Singapore had almost no natural resources. Relied on Malaya (now Malaysia) for defense and clean water. Lots of corruption. Per capita GDP below $430.
    - Lee Kuan Yew became prime minister in 1959. He changed the system of governance, introduced the British system of justice and rule by Law. Addressed corruption (made illegal activities less attractive by raising salaries of civil servants). Enforced rules. Open government was encouraged by creation of multi-cultural councils giving voice to religious and ethnic groups.  
    - Singapore now has a government that ranks with New Zealand and Scandanavian countries, one of the least corrupt in the world.
    - By 2015, per capita GDP = $55,182 (higher than the U.S.), annual growth was 6.69 percent. 
    
🔑 **Market Failures**
- 🔖 Market failure: when "good" (fair) interactions fail to occur, or "bad" interactions do. 4 main causes: 
  - 1. Information asymmetry
      - When one party knows facts that other parties don't, and uses that for personal advantage. 
  - 2. Externalities
      - When spillover costs or benefits accrue to anyone not involved in a given interaction.
      - Negative externality example: Friend gives away your private contact information to a gaming company for some points. 
      - Positive externalitities are a bit more ambiguous. 💼 **Netflix** analyzes the behavior of someone with similar tastes as you, and that ends up giving you better movie recommendations. Users in this system are less likely to complain. From business standpoint, this is still a problem "since they reflect value that is not being fully captured by the platform". 
      - Ideally, based on economic theory, every value would be accounted for and credited accurately. 
      - Similar to a public good, where the value is not fully captured by the party that created it. Individuals tend not to create these unless a governing mechanism is put in place to recognize and reward the effort. 
  - 3. Monopoly power
      - When one supplier in an ecosystem becomes too powerful (through control of the supply), and uses the power to demand higher prices/special favors. 
      - 💼 **Zynga**, games company, in 2009/2010, very powerful on Facebook. Led to conflicts around sharing user information, revenues, etc. 
  - 4. Risk
      - The possibility that something unexpected and essentially unpredictable may go wrong, turning a good interaction into a bad one.
- 💼 **eBay**
    - Most interactions are basically fair, even when there is a "winner" and "loser". Sometimes, manipulative or deceptive actions take place. 
    - Example of a market failure: A group of sellers noticed that some eBay inexperienced sellers would misidentify goods (often misspelling the brand name), and noticed that they could scoop up valuable items at a lesser price, and resell on eBay for a profit. "Allsop's Arctic Ale" was from a crew that navigated the Arctic in the 1850s, the only two bottles left were eagerly sought after — ultimately was sold for $304 due to the mispelled "Allsopp" in the listing, then purchased and re-sold for $78,100. 
      
      
🔑 **Tools for platform governance**
- Four main sets of tools, generally need to use all of these: 
  - 1. Laws
  - 2. Norms
  - 3. Architecture
  - 4. Markets
- Need all of these tools to change social behavior. 
  - 💼 **Reducing the harmful effects of smoking**, used all four tools: laws (ban cigarette sales to minors, no smoking in public spaces), norms (social pressure or advertising to stigmatize smoking), architecture (air filters that clean the air, smokeless devices), and market mechanisms (taxing tobacco products or subsidizing "quit smoking" programs).
  
🔑 **Tool 1: Laws**
- Laws can be tricky. Laws can apply to platform businesses and participants, but it's not always clear who is responsible and should be held accountable. 
- Case law generally doesn't hold platforms accountable for misdeeds of users, although platform owners actually can regulate and control the behavior of users. 
- Governance within the platform business is another matter: these are the explicit rules (ToS, rules of stakeholder behavior that designers come up with). This moderates behavior on the platform at the user and ecosystem level. 
  - Underlying principle for governance: Give fast, open feedback when applying laws that define good behavior, but slow, opaque feedback when applying laws that punish bad behavior. 
  - Generally, these platform laws should be transparent. 
    - 💼 **Stack Overflow** has explicit list of rules for earning points, and the rights/privileges that these points award to users. Points gain you the right to ask/answer questions, upvote/downvote someone's content, see fewer ads. This list of rules and rewards creates a public good by encouraging users to be good actors and share good insights. 
  - Sometimes these rules shouldn't be transparent, because it may facilitate bad behavior.
    - 💼 **Dating sites**: When stalkers understand what is considered "bad behavior" on a platform, they learn to game it. Platforms that delay the negative consequences of certain behaviors results in stalkers having a harder time identifying the trigger and working around the system.
  
🔑 **Tool 2: Norms**
- Vibrant communities are a huge asset to a platform, and these are generally nurtured by skilled managers that develop norms, culture, and expectations that generate lasting sources of value. 
- 💼 **iStockphoto**
  - Originally a business that sold CD-ROM collections of images by direct mail. Wasn't going well, so they started giving away images online. Users discovered them, wanted to use the images and also upload their own. 
  - In order to maintain quality, every image was scrutinized by an inspector. This was costly, couldn't scale. 
  - They turned to crowd curation. People uploading content could earn their way into becoming inspectors, had specific topic spaces they inspected. CEO gave a lot of praise and feedback to these users. The norms established here led to a huge amount of high quality stock photos, which is a public good. 
  - The established norms in the community included: 
    - Feedback
    - High quality content
    - Open engagement
    - Natural role progression to greater levels of authority 
- Norms can be created through behavior design. 
  - 🔖 Behavior design = a recurring sequence of trigger, action, reward, and investment.
    - Trigger: platform based signal, message, or alert (email, web link, news item, notification) 
    - Action: The trigger prompts platform member to take an action. 
    - Reward: The action produces a reward for the member. Bonus if it's a variable/unexpected value, which creates habit-forming behaviors. 
    - Investment: the platform then asks the user for an investment (time, data, social capital, money), which deepens the participant's commitment and reinforces behavior patterns. 
  - 💼 **Behavior design example: Pinterest**
    - Someone sees an interesting photo on Facebook (the trigger), clicks on it (the action, should be frictionless) and lands on Pinterest. Her reward is all the good content on Pinterest related to that photo that are curated to be interesting to her. Then Pinterest asks for an investment, like inviting friends, giving her preferences, learning new features. This sets up new triggers and the process starts again.  
  - Behavior design can result in a public good or value, but it can also be manipulative and doesn't always benefit participants. This is why users should understand how governance mechanisms work. **It's important to have users participate in shaping the systems that govern them.**
    - Communities that successfully create and police public goods tend to have several regular patterns (observation by Elinor Ostrom, first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Economics)
      - 1. Clearly defined boundaries between who has access to community benefits and who doesn't. 
      - 2. People affected by how resources are used are given recognized channels they can use to influence the decision-making process
      - 3. Community monitors are accountable to the community.
      - 4. Various levels of increasing sanctions are applied to those who violate community rules. 
      - 5. Members can use low-cost dispute resolution systems
      - 6. As community resources scale, governance should be in a series of nested tiers: simple issues controlled by small, local user groups, while complex/global problems managed by more formally organized groups. 
      - 💼 **eBay**
        - Friction between buyers and sellers when trying to update the traditional auction format. Buyers liked fixed prices, sellers didn't. To resolve, used a number of Ostrom's ideas: 
          - Focus groups and a "voices" program to reflect user perspectives and gauge the priority of their feelings. 
          - Thoughtful communications about proposed changes
          - Tested programs on smaller groups, pulled back on bad changes
        - Ended up siding with the buyers, reasoning that sellers would remain loyal to the platform since that's where the buyers are. Today, "Buy it now" fixed-price listings account for 70 percent of eBay's gross merchandise volume. 
        
🔑 **Tool 3: Architecture**
- In a platform business, architecture = programming code. 
- "Well-designed software systems are self-improving: they encourage and reward good behavior, thereby producing more of the same."
  - 💼 **Online banking platforms: peer-to-peer lending**
    - These businesses use algorithms to displace traditional labor-intensive loan officers. They use conventional (credit scores) and unconventional (Yelp ratings, online connections) data to calculate a borrower's likelihood of repaying. As this algorithm gets better, risk declines, which attracts more lenders. Low overhead costs = low rates = more borrowers. 
- Architecture can be used to prevent and correct market failures.
  - 💼 **eBay**
    - The middlemen who exploited the inexperienced sellers (previous case study) were problematic, but they did provide market liquidity known as arbitrage. Without these arbitrageurs, nothing would happen, so they're providing a service while also highlighting a market inefficiency. To deal with this, eBay created automated systems like spelling assistance to provide confidence that sellers will receive an item's worth.
    - This is good governance that may disenfranchise the arbitrageurs, but increases the overall health of the system. 
  - 💼 **Bitcoin**
    - In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper on Cryptography, defined the Bitcoin digital currency and the blockchain protocol governing it. 
    - Blockchain is revolutionary: it allows for decentralized, completely trustworthy interactions without any need for escrow payments or other guarantees.
    - 🔖 **Blockchain**: distributed public ledger that enables storage of data in a container (the block) affixed to other containers (the chain). 
    - The resulting smart, autonomous contracts execute the rules automatically. An exchange of services and payment are ensured without either party controlling the system.
    - This has led to a new kind of platform: open architecture and a governance model but no central authority. Also addresses monopoly power - no one can remake these rules to favor one participant over another. 

🔑 **Tool 4: Markets**
- Markets can govern behavior using human motivations like fun, fame, and fortune. Social currency is often more valuable than money. 
  - Ex. Providing a good interaction, quality content, and social network — a foundation for reputation.
- 💼 **iStockphoto**
  - Provided virtual currency in form of photo download credits. Original uploader of photo receives the cost of a download at 1 credit. Credits could be purchased with money, and uploaders could cash out accumulated credits. Professional and nonprofessional photographers could both benefit from participating in the same market.
- 💼 **SAP (Enterprise Management Platform Company)**
  - To motivate developers to answer one another's questions: when someone from a company answers a question, points are credited to the company's account. At a certain level of points, SAP will make a contribution to a charity of the company's choice. That has saved SAP $6-8 million in tech support costs, created new product dieas, and reduced response time to qeustions. Accounts for a $500,000 gain in annual productivity per enterprise software partner. 
  - Social currency used to stimulate SAP's developer economy: When SAP introduced a new CRM, it offered double points for any answers, code, or white paper related to the CRM. In 2 months, this led to developers finding gaps in the software and developing new features.
- ❓Given that useful ideas are public goods, what's the best intellectual property policy for a platform business? When developers on a platform produce valuable inventions, does ownership lie with the developer or the platform? 
  - This is complicated. Ownership to developers = incentive for creation, but giving ownership to the platform facilitates standardization and sharing. 
  - SAP had 2 practices to tackle the problem of ownership. 
    - 1. Published a 2-year advance roadmap detailing new products and services. Served as a metaphorical patent period for outside developers.
    - 2. Partnered with developers financially (sometimes via acquisition). Ensured fair compensation, reduced partner risk, and encouraged outside investment in the SAP platform.
- Risk reduction is an old problem; platform owners tend to avoid responsibility for risks faced by platform participants.
- 💼 **Fair Credit Reporting Act 1970**
  - Background: Credit card companies avoided insuring cardholders; argued that insurance would promote fraud, resulting in careless cardholders and banks becoming more reluctant to extend credit, which would hurt low-income customers.
  - The amendments required fraud insurance and imposed a 50$ limit on consumer liability for fraud on their credit cards.
  - Without having to worry about fraud, consumers ended up using their cards much more.
  - This was so successful that many banks now waive the 50$ charge if a lost or stolen card is reported within a day.
- 💼 **Others**
  - Airbnb refused to compensate hosts for bad guest behavior. Uber refused to insure riders for bad driver behavior.
  - Both companies recognized that this hurt growth of their platforms, and have introduced insurance.
- Good governance: rather than minimize their own risk, platforms should reduce risks for their participants to maximize value creation.

🔑**Principles of Smart self-governance**
- When platforms adopt the rules that apply to partners and participants, results improve.
- 1. **Internal transparency**: clear and consistent communication / vision across divisons inside a company.
  - Internal departments in companies tend to become siloed and develop unique perspectives, languages, systems, etc. This makes it difficult to solve complex problems that require collaboration between two departments, or engage effectively with users and partners.
  - Platform managers need to deliver clear, consistent vision across the entire platform.
  - 🔖 The Yegge Rant was issued by Jeff Bezos of Amazon as a framework for clear communication. It mandates the exclusive use of service interfaces, which are data communication tools specifically designed to be clear, understandable, and useful internally and externally.
  - 1. All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.
  - 2. Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.
  - 3. There will be no other forms of interprocess communication allowed.
  - 4. This is technology-agnostic.
  - 5. All service interfaces must be designed from the group up and be exposed to developers to the outside world.
  - 6. Those who don't do this are fired.
  - 7. Have a nice day!
- This helped Amazon consolidate its various web service operations to store, search, and communicate data to one operation with universally comprehensive protocols.
- This had implications for utility in external applications for customers.
- It is hard to scale if companies cannot see across their divisions.
- 💼**Sony**
  - Walkman dominated portable music since 1970s. A few years after initial introduction, the iPhone swept the field. 
  - Sony never developed a vision to offer a platform despite introducing the PlayStation Portable, owning Time Warner movie and TV studios.
- 2. **Participation**: platforms should give external stakeholders an equal voice in internal decisions. Otherwise, bias towards favoring the platform over partners can lead to platform abandonement.
  - 💼**USB promoted by Intel**
    - First standard to facilitate data nd power transfer between peripherals (keyboards, memory devices, monitors, etc)
    - However, peripherals were not inside Intel's core microchip business. Problem was chicken-egg; who produces peripherals for a standard no one has adopted, who buys a computer that doesn't have peripherals made for yet? Outsiders reluctant to partner with Intel, because Intel would have monopoly over the standard.
    - Intel entrusted this problem with IAL (Intel Architecture Labs), which was not controlled by any internal product. Served as neutral negotiator between ecosystem and internal business. Earned trust of partners by advocating for policies that benefited ecosystem at the expense of Intel business.
    - IAL invited over 50 companies to help define the standard and license. Intel committed to not trample partners' markets, used reputation and contracts to limit its own future behavior.

- Governance will be imperfect because partners will find new forms of private advantage. When platforms allow third parties to innovate, platforms will struggle to control that value.
- When conflicts of control arise, governance should favor greatest sources of new value or trend in the new direction; otherwise, face stagnation.
- Governance systems should be flexible to respond to both fast and slow moving parts.
