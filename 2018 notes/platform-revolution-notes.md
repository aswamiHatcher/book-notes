## Chapter 7: Openness

### Chapter focus: 

### Notes: 

🔖 **Definition of openness:**
> A platform is 'open' to the extent that: 
> 1. No restrictions are placed on participation in its development, commercialization, or use; or
> 2. any restrictions - for example, requirements ot conform with technical standards or pay licensing fees - are reasonable and non-discriminatory, that is, they are applied uniformly to all potential platform participants.

- Openness levels exist on a spectrum, and where a business decides to land on that spectrum affects usage, developer participation, monetization, and regulation. 
- There are pros/cons at ever point in the spectrum
- Defining who has access, and how they can participate is very complex. Should be at the top of a platform managers agenda at all times. 

💼 **Wikipedia:**
- Wikipedia is the most popular reference site in the world
- Is a universally accessible, unlimited source of data that should be reliable
- There are a lot of cases of misinformation on the site. Example: people editing the "Murder of Meredith Kercher" 8,000 times, mostly by people who are biased towards believing that Amanda Knox is guilty. 
- Wikipedia is an incredibly open platform, and this is a good example of the tradeoffs inherent in providing something that is openly accessible while trying to still maintain high quality. If Wikipedia were closed, it would reduce participation. 

💼 **Apple's transition from closed to something more balanced:**
- in 1980s, Jobs chose to keep the Apple Macintosh a closed system, while Microsoft opened an OS to outside developers and licensed it to many computer manufacturers. 
- Microsoft had a flood of innovation, Windows claimed a much larger share of the personal computer market. 
- In 2000s, Jobs opened the iPhone OS, made iTunes available on Windows. This was a better balance, Apple captured more o fthe smartphone market compared to Nokia and Blackberry. 
- Jobs interpreted the openness spectrum as "fragmented" (open) vs. "integrated" (closed); this terminoligy biased the debate to favor closed, controlled systems.

💼 **Myspace vs. Facebook:**
- The shift from Myspace to Facebook: 
  - Myspace dominated social networking before Facebook. It released a ton of features, but constrained engineering resources meant they were often buggy and had poor user experience. They decided to keep the site closed to outside developers and couldn't solve this. 
  - In retrospect, cofounder Chris DeWolfe says that they should have focused on 5 - 10 key features and let the rest be built by outside developers. 
  - Facebook was initially closed to outside innovators, but opened to dot-com users in 2006 and started gaining on Myspace. 
  - in May 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Platform to help developers create apps. This led to a large shift, ended up with 7,000 side applications by November. Myspace reacted by also opening to developers in 2008, but it was too late. 
- Myspace was _too_ open
  - Self-serve advertising = an overly accessible path for inappropriate content. No focus on curating content. 

💼 **Youtube:**
- Highly open system = delivers a wide array of content from all types of content creators. 

🔑 **Three kinds of openness decisions that managers face:**
1. Manager/sponsor participation
    - Two entities behind a platform: a firm that manages the platform, and the firm that sponsors the platform 
    - Sometimes these are the same thing: Facebook, Uber, eBay, Airbnb. 
    - Sometimes these are not the same: Manager has more influence over daily operations and the developers, the sponsor has legal and economic control, as well as long-term strategy. 
    - See next 🔑 for examples
2. Developer participation
    - Managers need to control the level of openness to developers
    - See section on "🔑 developer participation" below.
3. User participation
    - Managers need to control the level of openness to users
    - See section on "🔑 user participation" below.
  
🔑 **1. Management and sponsorship of a platform can be controlled by:**
- Depending on 4 combinations, there are different patterns of openness and control, different advantages and disadvantages. A platform can also migrate from one model to another.  
- The Proprietary Model: A single firm does it all (provides the greatest control and faciliatates closed system of operation.)
  - Underlying hardware/software for the Mac OS and mobile iOS are controlled by Apple.
  - Feels like the dream; capture an entire market through developing a new technology standard and maintaining control over it. But this can backfire: 
    - 💼 **Betamax videotape sponsored by Sony vs. VHS sponsored by JVC.**
      - Betamax was higher quality, but this "war" was decided based on differing sponsorship/management strategies. 
      - Sony used proprietary model, JVC used licensing model. 
      - Manufacturers could produce VHS recorders and players, led to more volume and falling prices, more consumers buying. Movie studios issued more products in VHS format. 
      - VHS won out, although JVC didn't get much financially in the long run. 
- The Licensing Model: A group of firms manages, one firm sponsors (open at one end, closed at another)
  - Google sponsors the Android OS, but encourages other firms to supply devices. 
- The Joint Venture Model: Single firm manages, group of firms sponsor (open at one end, closed at another)
  - Orbitz launched as a joint venture with many major airlines.
  - Can be challenging to make key decisions when there's a committee of owners with different goals. 
    - 💼 **Visa**, which was sponsored by a number of banks since the 70s, ended up shifting the business to a self-contained entity that fit into the proprietary model in 2007. 
- The Shared Model: Groups of firms manages, another group of firms sponsors (open to both managers and sponsors)
  - Linux OS has a platform connecting app developers to consumers. Managing companies include TiVo, Roomba, Ubuntu, Qualcomm, while corporate sponsors include IBM, Intel, HP, Fujitsu, NEC, Oracle, Samsung.
  
- How do you choose which sponsorship/management model to choose? 
  - Tradeoffs inherent in these models are complicated. 
    - 💼 **Apple vs. Google smartphones**:
      - The iPhone (more controlled) considered more user friendly and aesthetically pleasing than Google's smartphone (less controlled).
      - Android Open Source Platform (AOSP) permits experimentation by any company. 
      - By 2014, open innovation led Android to 80 percent market share, Apple at 15 percent. 
      - Does this mean Google is better? Maybe not. AOSP OS doesn't channel users to Google's online services, which means Google gets no revenue or data flow from AOSP devices. Google is now reversing course and closing Android. 
  - Choose based on why the platform is being developed and the goals of those designing it:
    - 💼 **RFID tech**
      - Used to create smart tags for products for inventory control. 
      - Uses a shared model: sponsored by many retailers, manufactured by many companies. 
      - RFID doesn't generate huge profits, but it reaches the goal of the sponsors: make the technology simple, accessible, and affordable. 
      
🔑 **2. Developer Participation**
- Three kinds of developers: 
  1. Core developers: create the core platform cuntions that provide value to platform participants.
      - Goal: get the platform to users, deliver value through tools and rules around the core interaction. Responsible for basic platform capabilities. 
  2. Extension developers: Add features and value to the platform and enhance its functionality. 
      - Usually outside parties. Managers have to decide how open they want to be to these developers. 
      - Ex. People who produce apps sold via the iTunes store
      - Companies will usually create an application programming interface (API) to regulate these developers, manage access to the system. 
      - 🔖 **An API** is a standardized set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications that makes it easy for an outside programmer to write code that will connect with the platform infrastructure. 
      - 💼 **Walmart vs. Amazon's APIs**: Amazon has 300 API "mashups", Walmart has one API, which is partially why Amazon pulled ahead of Walmart in the stock market in 2015. 
      - 💼 **Salesforce** generates 50 percent of its revenues through APIs.
  3. Data aggregators
      - Enhance the matching function of the platform by adding data from multiple sources. They take data from the platform and sell to other companies for activities such as ad placement, and share profits with the original platform company. 
      - When it works well, it provides good matches for consumers. When it doesn't, it's very creepy. 
      - "Managing [this] appropriately poses an enormous ethical, legal, and business challenge."
  
      💼 **Developer Participation Case Study: Airbnb** 
      - Core developers: 
        - provides infrastructure that allows guests and hosts to interact. 
        - manages background functions that reduce transaction costs (ex. default insurance contracts for both parties)
      - Extension developers:
        - Ex. Developer now offers professional support under "Airbnb photography service" to create compelling images for hosts.
        - If Airbnb is too closed, makes it hard for extension developers to provide value. If too open, increases existance of low-quality providers which damage Airbnb's reputation, too many providers competing for the same profits. 
        - Airbnb takes the middle route: it has an API, but it is not open to all developers. 

      💼 **Developer participation and APIs case study: The Guardian**
      - The Guardian is a British daily newspaper. Originally closed to extension developers, but decided to "open in" the website "by bringing in more data and applications from the outside", and "open out" the site, by "enabling partners to create products using Guardian content and services on other digital platforms".
      - For "open out", they created a set of APIs with three different levels of access: 
        - 1. Keyless, the lowest access tier: anyone can use headlines, metadata, and information architecture without permission / without needing to share revenue.
        - 2. Approved, second access tier: allows time and usage restrictions, ad revenues are shared.
        - 3. Bespoke, highest tier: support package and gives unlimited content for a fee.
        - This has led to more products like a Politics API, and an app framework. Over 2,000 extension developers signed up in the first year. APIs can attract extension developers. 

      ❓When does the outside developer threaten that of the platform, and how should managers respond? 
      - Three principles to use when assessing the situation: 
        - 1. Based on the value created by a specific extension app. Don't let an outside developer control a main source of user value. One way to address this is to acquire the app. 
            - 💼 **Apple** owns most of the main apps on the iPhone. Bought SRI, the company behind Siri. 
        - 2. If an app has potential to become a powerful platform itself, the manager should try to own it or replace it. 
            - 💼 **Google Maps** was a popular feature on the iPhone, very powerful and popular. Apple decided to make its own mapping software, not dependent on Google anymore. 
        - 3. If specific functionality is reinvented by many extension developers and platform users like it, the manager of the platform should acquire this functionality and make it available through an API. Ex. Video/audio playback, photo editing, voice commands. = more innovation and better service for users.  

🔑 **3. User Participation**
- Managers need to address 🔖 **producer openness**: the right to freely add content to the platform
- Goal is usually high quality content, which means platforms cannot generally be completely open. 
- 🔖 **Curation**: content protection process that can be fine-tuned to land on the right level of producer openness. Usually takes the form of screening and feedback at critical points. 
  - Options: Can use human moderators, although this can be time-consuming and costly. Alternative is using the users themselves via software tools, although this is hard to design and implement. 
  - When curation tools bias towards openness, it can let in offensive and dangerous content. When they bias towards restrictions, valuable content can be lost. Platform managers need to devote a lot of resources, including human "eyeballs"/human judgement, to getting better at this balance.
  - 💼 **Wikipedia**: originally tried to be completely open, and assumed that users would be able to curate content/challenge biases. But reality was messy. 
    - Now relies on community standards and social pressure.
    - When that's not enough, uses other methods like VandalProof (software that highlights articles editing by "bad actor" users), tagging tools, blocking/prevention systems. 
  
🔑 **Two separate platforms may compete on the basis of how they differ in level of open/closed**
- There are a lot of factors in being competitive with other platforms, which can result in a never-ending balancing act and continuous adjustements of a platform's level of openness. 

🔑 **As platforms mature, they tend to grow in the direction of openness (although sometimes the opposite direction)** 
- Changes in open/closed come from reevaluation and adjustment of curation processes.
- Goal: great high quality platform content and service value.
- The challenge is finding a balance as openness policies evolve. 
- Example of struggle for control: 
  - SAP, a German company that makes software for large enterprises to manage internal operations. Partnered with ADP for payroll processing, which gave ADP the opportunity to replace SAP as the primary manager of the customer relationship.
